# While the Docker images themselves are supported for production usage,
# this docker-compose.yaml is designed to be used by developers to run
# an environment locally. It is not designed to be used in production.
# We recommend to use Kubernetes in production with our Helm Charts:
# https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/install/
# For local development, we recommend using KIND instead of `docker-compose`:
# https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/local-kubernetes-cluster/

# This is a lightweight configuration with Orchestration (Zeebe + Operate + Tasklist), Connectors, and Elasticsearch
# See docker-compose-full.yaml for a configuration that also includes Optimize, Identity, Keycloak, Web Modeler, and Console.
